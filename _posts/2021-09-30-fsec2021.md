Here is some writeups of the challenges

# Corrupt (Forensics)

## Challenges file:
- [flag.png](/uploads/fsec2021/corrupt/flag.png)

We are given a PNG image file, view it with Photo viewer looks blank..

Check it with `file` command it stated it only have 1x1 pixel:
```bash
file flag.png
flag.png: PNG image data, 1 x 1, 8-bit grayscale, non-interlaced
```
But it has 696 bytes, so I guess the size has been modify

Basically we need to change the PNG to the correct size to view the flag

After some research, found out we can modify the size of PNG using Hexeditor, based on [this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hex-editing-width-height-png-files-ciaran-mc-ardle/)

But how to we know the original PNG size?? 

Running `pngcheck` also shown no errors
```bash
pngcheck -v flag.png
File: flag.png (696 bytes)
  chunk IHDR at offset 0x0000c, length 13
    1 x 1 image, 8-bit grayscale, non-interlaced
  chunk pHYs at offset 0x00025, length 9: 5039x5039 pixels/meter (128 dpi)
  chunk tEXt at offset 0x0003a, length 25, keyword: Software
  chunk IDAT at offset 0x0005f, length 581
    zlib: deflated, 32K window, default compression
  chunk IEND at offset 0x002b0, length 0
No errors detected in flag.png (5 chunks, -69500.0% compression).
```
## Find the original size
After some researching, I came across [this article](https://pyokagan.name/blog/2019-10-14-png/)

In the pixel data part, we can see it calculate the expected IDAT size based on *width* and *height*

![image1](/uploads/fsec2021/corrupt/image1.png)

Therefore, another way around we can also calculate *width* and *height* based on IDAT size!

To find IDAT data size, we need to decompress the zlib compression

It got many ways to do it, I use linux command to do it

First, I use `binwalk` to extract the zlib data
```bash
binwalk -e flag.png

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             PNG image, 1 x 1, 8-bit grayscale, non-interlaced
99            0x63            Zlib compressed data, default compression
```
Then go to `_flag.png.extracted`, running `zlib-flate` will decompress the zlib data, and `wc` will count the data size
```bash
zlib-flate -uncompress < 63.zlib | wc
      0       0   20100
```
Can see the data size is `20100`, put it in the equation:
```
height x (1 + width x bytesPerPixel) = 20100
```
Next we need to find `bytesPerPixel`, if is RGBA image each pixel is 4 bytes long

This image is *8-bit grayscale*, doing a quick google search can find it is 1 byte

![image2](/uploads/fsec2021/corrupt/image2.png)

Therefore, the equation become:
```
height x (1 + width) = 20100
```
We can guess the *height* and *width* is **200** or **100**

Lets try to edit the size using hexeditor

Hex of 200 is `c8` and 100 is `64`:

View it in Photo Viewer, and we saw the flag!!

Althought we didn't solve this is finals, but still fun to solve it after

# Parent Sharp

## Challenge file:
- [Parent_Sharp.exe](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/Parent_Sharp.exe)

We get a windows executable, running `file` command can see it is a .NET assembly (Means it written using microsoft .net framework)

```bash
file Parent_Sharp.exe
Parent_Sharp.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows
```

We can view the source code and even debug it using [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) in windows

Using dnSpy to open `Parent_Sharp.exe`, we are able to see all of the source code inside:

![image1](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image1.png)

Press Start to run it, it just print some words and exit:
```
Baby Shark dududududu
Find the mini shark dododododo
Find the naugthy shark dadadadada

fsdududududucyberx is not the flag dududu
``` 

Notice after running it, got a new file `MessageFromAuthor.txt` add to same directory.. interesting

Inside the file is just `Baby Shark dodododo Baby Sharp dudududu`

## Debug and analyze

Same as C program, it also have a Main function

Inside the main function we can see it got some byte array like `pwx`, `dada` `dada2` `dada3` `dada4`

Then it pass into a function in `KJASD`:
```cs
string @string = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(KJASD.cHalala(pwx, dada));
string string2 = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(KJASD.cHalala(pwx, dada2));
string string3 = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(KJASD.cHalala(pwx, dada3));
string string4 = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(KJASD.cHalala(pwx, dada4));
```

We can set a breakpoint to see what is the string returned

Just behind the line number then it set a breakpoint at this line:

![image2](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image2.png)

Click start, when enter the breakpoint the `Locals` tab will appear some variables

After that, click `Step Over` or F10 to move forward

Then you will see the string `kernel32.dll` return in Locals:

![image3](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image3.png)

Continue to step over, we can see the 4 strings return is:
```
"kernel32.dll"
"CreateFileA"
@".\MessageFromAuthor.txt"
"Baby Shark dodododo Baby Sharp dudududu"
```

Below got string5 which returns `WriteFile`

Notice the `MessageFromAuthor.txt` we saw before, we can guess the code below is just importing `CreateFileA` `WriteFile` from `kernel32.dll` and create the file with the name and write the file with the content

After that, you will see a large chunk of code with base64:
```cs
byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("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......");
Type type = Assembly.Load(new bsd(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes).ToCharArray()).gdgdgd()).GetType("Baby_Sharp.shark_call");
Console.WriteLine(Assembly.Load(new bsd(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes).ToCharArray()).gdgdgd()));
object obj = Activator.CreateInstance(type);
Console.WriteLine(((string)type.GetMethod("dudu").Invoke(obj, null)).Substring(0, 87));
type.GetMethod("rktrkt");
Console.WriteLine((string)type.GetMethod("Sharp").Invoke(obj, new object[]
{
	array
}));
```

Basically the base64 is assembly machine code (also known as shellcode)

You can see it decode it and pass it into `Assembly.Load`:
```cs
Type type = Assembly.Load(new bsd(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes).ToCharArray()).gdgdgd()).GetType("Baby_Sharp.shark_call");
```
Then it calls methods inside the `Baby_Sharp.shark_call` class, 3 methods `dudu`,`rktrkt` and `Sharp`

So how do we decompile or disassembly the bytes code??

## Source of Baby_Sharp

Thanks to dnSpy, we no need to disassembly manually, we just need to keep clicking `Step Into` until it reach the `Baby_Sharp` methods

Then you will see the source code

First, we need to understand how to use the `Step Into` `Step Over` and `Step Out` 
 when debugging

1. **Step Into** is go into the next function
2. **Step Over** is skip the next function
3. **Step Out** is skip the current function

When it execute this statement:
```cs
Console.WriteLine(((string)type.GetMethod("dudu").Invoke(obj, null)).Substring(0, 87));
```
First it will call `GetMethod` then `Invoke`, `Substring` then `WriteLine`

We want to get into `Invoke` function, so we skip the first function

### Steps to get in

- Set breakpoint before it call `dudu`

![image4](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image4.png)

- Click start then click step over and step into, you will see it get into the `Invoke` function

![image5](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image5.png)

- Keep clicking step into, eventually it will reach the `dudu` function

![image6](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image6.png)

- After that, the source code of `Baby_Sharp` is added in the left panel:

![image7](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image7.png)

## Solving

Lets see the `Sharp` function:
```cs
public string Sharp(byte[] kay)
{
	if (File.Exists(".\\MessageFromAuthor.txt"))
	{
		return "fsdududududucyberx is not the flag dududu";
	}
	shark_call.rktrkt(shark_call.dada);
	byte[] bytes = shark_call.cHalala(kay, shark_call.dada);
	return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes);
}
```
As you can see, it if the file `MessageFromAuthor` exists

If exist it returns the output we seen when we test run 

Lets try what will happen when we delete the file in when running

Set a breakpoint before calling `Sharp`:

![image8](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image8.png)

Click start then delete the `MessageFromAuthor.txt` then click continue


```
Baby Shark dududududu
Find the mini shark dododododo
Find the naugthy shark dadadadada

fsB4bySh4rpcyberx
```
**Boom! THE FLAG appear!**

Looks like we just need to delete the txt file to solve this

Thats it, no need to analyse compilcated code we are able to solve this

## Alternative Solution

After the finals, I notice we also can save the assembly of `Baby_Sharp` by debugging

Set a breakpoint at the `Assembly.Load` function:

![image9](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image9.png)

Click start, then keep step into and step out until it reach `Assembly.Load` function, you will see a `rawBinary` in the Locals tab:

![image10](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image10.png)

Right Click it > Save 

![image11](/uploads/fsec2021/parent/image11.png)

After that, open the binary with dnSpy you will get the source code of `Baby_Sharp`

# Summary
It was a great CTF, can see it getting harder compare to last year. The challenges all were great and nice, this is the last year we participate for this competition because we graduated and this competition is only for Uni students. Hope in the future, our juniors can participate and win the prize!
